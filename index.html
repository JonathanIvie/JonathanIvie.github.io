            <p> Once upon a time in a kingdom far far away there lived a very awesome ogre named Shrek. He saved his swamp from the evil Lord Farquad... No one really likes him He dumped a bunch of fairy tail creatures in his swamp. But he didn't check himself... Before he Shreked himself. Enough about him though. He is the villan in the story of Shrek. </p>
